\begin{abstract}

Mechanisms Design is a very interesting field of economics. In this paper, theories about general mechanisms are presented as well as some kinds of special mechanisms such as matching. With all the needed 
details provided or given in the literature, the thesis is mostly a reflection of the author's interest and provide insightful arguments and findings in related areas.

For two particular kinds of interdependent value problems, the VCG mechanism is adapted to achieve ex post implementation of social efficiency result. The uniqueness of tranfer schemes for ex post implementation of continuously differentible social goal with interdependent private signals are shown when such scheme does exist. For the discrete social goals, allocation of one and many goods are considered.
Under the interdependent value environment, the paper proposes a sufficient condition for ex post implementation of efficiency in an one-good auction, i.e., allocating the good to the agent who values it most.This condition is less demanding than a sufficient condition that is proposed in \parencite{Maskin00}. Then the paper further extend the sufficient condition to the case of multiple goods assignment with interdependent values and call the extended condition Condition $\rho$. Then we provide a model where Condition $\rho$ is satisfied and we design a mechanism to ex post implement the social efficiency maximizing goal through appropriate money transfer.

For the Chinese college admission mechanism, the paper finds that the allocation results of the ex post
equilibrium in the Boston Mechanism, Chinese parallel mechanism and the DA mechanism are the same under the same score-based priority structures. However, the ease for the DA mechanism to reach this allocation result can never be reached for the other two mechanisms, which might be a motivation for advocating DA mechanism in the Chinese college admission mechanism. Under general priority structures of the colleges, the sets of ex post equilibrium matching results for these mechanisms exibits a nested structure with or without province-oriented reserve policy, which still favors DA. 


For a perfect information competitive board game like chess which is a mechanism
for deciding win or loss, the last chapter of this paper classify every position 
into three categories, winning position, losing position, and drawing position, and provides the way to identify them theoretically. It is only theoretical for chess because the work need to be done is 
astronomical figure. However, the paper manages to use this method to solve an interesting game, which shows the power of the notions.
