(ii)When $v_{ik}(s_i, s_{-i})< v_{ik}(s_i^*, s_{-i})$, given others
truthfully revealing their private signals $s_{-i}$, the agent i's
best choice is to be allocated nothing and pay nothing. Truthful
revelation of $i$'s private signal $s_i$ is enough to insure that he
is allocated nothing, since according to Condition $\rho$, nothing
will be allocated to $i$ in all the social value maximizing schemes
which will be enforced by the mechanism. Therefore truthful revelation
of the signal $s_i$ in this case is also incentive compatible.
